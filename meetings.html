          <p>Today, we went over the basic process for solving coding problems.  It basically came out to this:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Input data</li>
            <ol>
              <li>nextLine() from scanner</li>
              <li>Organize data, usually involving a str.split(" ")</li>
              <li>Possibly store data</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Analyze data</li>
            <li>Print output</li>
            </ol>
          <p>We completed problems 1 and 2 from the Code Quest packet, the code for #2 is on the drive</p>
          <p>I taught an easy way to get the binary version of a decimal number:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Integer divide the number</li>
            <li>Record the remainder</li>
            <li>Repeat on the answer from step 1 until you end up with 0</li>
            <li>Write the remainders you got from right to left, and you have the answer!</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Example: 43/2 = 21 R1, 21/2 = 10 R1, 10/2 = 5 R0, 5/2 = 2 R1, 2/2 = 1 R0, 1/2 = 0 R1</p>
          <p>Answer: 101011</p>
          <p>I expanded the process to work for any base of numbers up to hexadecimal, the code is on the drive</p>
          <p>We ended with a related riddle:  10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 23, 30, 33, __, __ (what goes in the blanks?)</p>

        <h3 class="highColored oneIndent">4th</h3>
          <p>Today we completed a problem about folding arrays</p>
          <p>To fold the array [1,3,6,8], you fold it down the middle and add the numbers from the inside out to get [9,9]</p>
          <p>[8,6|</p>
          <p>[1,3|</p>
          <p>All work and code is on the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1wsPdjNvB1WbllLQ1VRMG1NV00" target="_blank">google folder</a>
        <h3 class="highColored oneIndent">18th</h3>
          <p>Today we created a GPA calculator, something practical!</p>
